# Vortex Hop
Vortex Hop, a 3D Hyper Casual Game
Try to move through the space by jumping from one platform to the other. Try not to fall!

##### How to play
In Vortex Hop, the main goal is to score as much as you can. Each time you jump to a platform you earn points.
- Control the ball by moving your finger on the screen and changing the gravity.
- If you cant land on a platform and fall you lose.
- You can land on the middle of some platform to make a perfect and get a multiplier for your score.
- There is a glass wall that you need to break at the end of each level to pass to the next level.
- The points you collect increases with your level, but the levels get harder and harder.

## Notes
- Vortex Hop is a game made using the Unity Game Engine.
- Shader graphs are used to create a the platform color change effect.
